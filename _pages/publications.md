**Lazzarini, D.**, Tota, A., Sorniotti, A.  
[*On the benefit of direct wheel torque control for longitudinal comfort enhancement on uneven roads*, IEEE IECON, 2025.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X24001861)  
**Key contribution:** Quantified longitudinal ride comfort improvements enabled by direct wheel torque control using nonlinear model predictive control with road preview, demonstrating superior performance of in-wheel motor architectures over conventional on-board powertrains across varying road roughness levels.

Stano, P., **Lazzarini, D.**, Santoro, S., et al.  
[*On-board electric powertrain control for the compensation of longitudinal acceleration oscillations caused by road irregularities*, *Mechanism and Machine Theory*, 2024.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11221399)  
**Key contribution:** Developed and validated a nonlinear model predictive control framework with road preview for on-board electric powertrains, achieving significant attenuation of longitudinal acceleration oscillations induced by road irregularities through simulation and experimental testing.
