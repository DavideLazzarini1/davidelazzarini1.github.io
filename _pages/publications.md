You can find my articles on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-EBujDMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Davide-Lazzarini-4) profiles.

**Lazzarini, D.**, Tota, A., Sorniotti, A.  
[_On the benefit of direct wheel torque control for longitudinal comfort enhancement on uneven roads_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11221399)  
_IECON 2025 - 51st Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society_, 2025.  
**Key contribution:** Provided a systematic comparison between in-wheel and on-board motor powertrain architectures under NMPC control, showing the inherent advantage of direct wheel torque actuation for longitudinal comfort on uneven roads.

Stano, P., **Lazzarini, D.**, Santoro, S., et al.  
[_On-board electric powertrain control for the compensation of longitudinal acceleration oscillations caused by road irregularities_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X24001861)  
_Mechanism and Machine Theory_, 2024.  
**Key contribution:** Developed and validated a nonlinear model predictive control framework with road preview for on-board electric powertrains, achieving significant attenuation of longitudinal acceleration oscillations induced by road irregularities through simulation and experimental testing.
