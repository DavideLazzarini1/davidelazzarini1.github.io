Ph.D. researcher in Mechanical Engineering at the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.dimeas.polito.it/en/), Politecnico di Torino, specializing in advanced control for vehicle dynamics.

I work on model-based and AI-driven control strategies for next-generation dynamic systems.
My experience includes MiL and HiL validation, as well as experimental testing on full-scale prototype vehicles.
I carried out experimental activities at leading institutions such as [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) and the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

I aim to apply my expertise in control, modelling, and AI across a wide range of high-performance and safety-critical domains.
